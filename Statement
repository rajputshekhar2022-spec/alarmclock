# Project Statement 
# Python Alarm Clock (Tkinter)

## Problem Statement:

People often forget important tasks, meetings, or reminders since they don't have a straightforward and quick way to set alarms. Many reminder applications on the market are complex, requiring access to the internet or complex setup.


This requires a simple, offline, and user-friendly alarm system that offers users the ability to set multiple alerts and have timely notifications without any extra dependencies.
