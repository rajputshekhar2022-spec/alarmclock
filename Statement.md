#  Project Statement 
# Python Alarm Clock

## Problem Statement:

Many people forget important tasks and daily routines due to the absence of an easy and quick reminder system. Most alarm applications are either overly complicated or require an internet connection or installation.

This project is a minimal, offline, and user-friendly alarm clock developed using Python and Tkinter.
